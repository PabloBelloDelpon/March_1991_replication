# March_1991_replication

Replication study of the paper "Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning" (March, 1991). 
The code for the simulation of figures 1 thru 5 was developed by [Maciej Workiewicz](https://github.com/Mac13kW/March_1991_Exploration_and_Exploitation) based on the original paper. The simulation of figure 6 is by Pablo Bello.

## Files :
* Each csv file contains the results of one simulation experiment.
* The R. files contain the different versions of the simulation needed to replicate the original figures on the paper.
* The .Rmd file imports the data from the experiments and create the plots.
